                <h1>RETTS for the entire chain of care</h1>
                <p>Due to the increased demand for validated and structured decision support systems, RETTS is used increasingly
                    in fields outside emergency medicine. This increase in the demand for the RETTS system has led to an
                    increase in the demands being placed on it. There is now a whole range of RETTS products available for
                    use online or offline, as well as for training and integration with medical records systems.</p>
